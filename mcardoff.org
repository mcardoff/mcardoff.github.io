Reach me at one of the following emails:

* Who am I?
I am a second year graduate student at Brandeis University, aspiring to study Experimental High Energy Physics

I am currently working in the ATLAS collaboration, mainly in tracking.
* Interesting Projects
Most of my projects for either fun or classes can be found on my [[https://github.com/mcardoff][github]] but here are some of the highlights
** Numerical Solver for the Schrodinger Equation
Both of these solvers solve the Schrodinger Equation in 1-D for an arbitrary potential, in a box going from $x=0$ to $x=a$
*** Matrix Method
Using the standard particle in a box states of sine functions, compute a Hamiltonian matrix $H$, and diagonalize it
*** RK4 Method
Simply solve the Schrodinger Differential equation numerically, using the Runge-Kutta 4 method.
** Racing Line Simulator Using Gradient Descent
I used a naive gradient descent algorithm to perturb the central line of a racing circuit to turn into a more ideal racing line, using a cost function from a few different papers. This was the final project for one of my classes in undergrad 
** Koch Snowflake Fractal Generator
** Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

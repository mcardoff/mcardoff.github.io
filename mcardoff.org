Reach me at one of the following emails:
- _mcardiff@brandeis.edu_ (preferred)
- _mcardiff@hawk.iit.edu_
* Who am I?
I am a first year graduate student at Brandeis University, aspiring to study Experimental High Energy Physics
* Interesting Projects
Most of my projects for either fun or classes can be found on my [[https://github.com/mcardoff][github]] but here are some of the highlights
** Numerical Solver for the Schrodinger Equation
Both of these solvers solve the Schrodinger Equation in 1-D for an arbitrary potential, in a box going from $x=0$ to $a$
*** Matrix Method
Using the standard particle in a box states of sine functions, compute a Hamiltonian matrix $H$, and diagonalize it
*** RK4 Method
Simply solve the Schrodinger Differential equation numerically, using the Runge-Kutta 4 method.
** Racing Line Simulator Using Gradient Descent
** Koch Snowflake Fractal Generator
** Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
